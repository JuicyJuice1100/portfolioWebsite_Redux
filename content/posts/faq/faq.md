### What's your bouldering climbing level
I would say I climb from V5 - V7.

### Console or PC?
PC master race baby!!

### What's your PC specs
Currently running a Corsair One a200:
- CPU: R9 5900X
- GPU: RTX 3080 Ti
- HDD: 2TB M.2
- Memory: 32 DDR4-3200

Decided to just get one of these cause of the form factor and cooling.  I love building PCs but making one in this small form factor that is fully liquid cooled is a pain. 

### What's your favorite video game
Ha, that's a toss up.  Probably between 2 games:
Super Smash Bros. Melee
Sekiro

### What's your favorite table top game
That's also a tough question.  I'd prob say:
1. Magic The Gathering
2. Elder Sign
3. Disney Villainous (Surprised by this one)

### What MTG Format do you play?
Commander.  I mostly play prebuilt decks.  I also do love drafting.

### Favorite dish to make
Chicken tikka masala.  Simple to make and tastes delicious.

### Favorite Dish
Palak paneer.  I'm a huge fan of indian food if you couldn't tell.  I just wish it was easier to make.

### Favorite Destination
Brugge, Belgium is prob my favorite.  Such a cool tiny place.  Definitely recommend if you get the chance.

### What's your ethnicity 
Filipino and Chinese
