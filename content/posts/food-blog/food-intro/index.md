### Why blog about food

Cooking food is a huge passion of mine.  However, my wife does not share the same passion.  Actually, she absolutely hates cooking.
I want to show that cooking can be fun and simple. 

I also believe that recipes are more of a guideline than something you absolutely have to follow.
You can be creative with recipes and make them your own.

This blog is aimed at the simple, home cook.  I may post some recipes, 
but I honestly if you're looking for something that you want to follow to a T you won't really see that on this blog.

### Mistakes will happen and that's okay

Don't expect to become an amazing cook overnight.  You might make mistakes, bad dishes, and that's okay.  We learn from our mistakes.  
I make mistakes all the time.  Cooking is a skill that you practice.  The more you do it the better you'll get.  Keep at it and you'll become a great homecook.

I will post my mistakes, talk about how I can possibly fix it for next time.  

Cooking should be fun and simple.
