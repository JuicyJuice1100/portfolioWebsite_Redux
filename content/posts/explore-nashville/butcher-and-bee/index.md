This spot has been on our radar for a while.  Multiple people have recommended it.  Because we're so close we definitely have to give it a try.  Plus my wife didn't want to cook that day.  It was her turn to cook which means she's paying :)

### Starters
*Whipped Feta* - Fermented honey, black pepper
- Even though this dish seems so simple it was definitely delicious.  I'd definitely get it again.  I will say I do love how simple this dish was that I might have to try making a version of it at home.  The only thing if they served it with something crunchy instead of a soft naan/pita it would have been perfect.  Totally, worth.

*Charred Shishito Peppers* - Sour Fig Honey, shisho
- These were good but I think if you can choose another you can skip this one.  To be honest I didn't really taste the sour fig honey with the peppers.  Mostly just tasted the charred pepper and what ever green was with it, I think it was mint?  Again, I think you can skip this one.

### Main Course
*Tomato & Plum Salad* - Fresh herbs, orange blossom labneh, sumac vinaigrette
- This was another dish that I found to be 'simple, yet satisfying'.  If you're looking for something light to share this is a great choice.  The plum with with the fresh herbs was delicious. I think if the plum was cut a little smaller it would have been perfect.  It was kind of difficult to get everything in one bite.  Quite pricey for the amount of salad you get but I think worth.

*Mushroom Shwarama* - Lion's mane mushroom, Tokyo onion tabbouleh, greek yogurt
- This was basically umami in shwarama form.  I mean my wife hates mushrooms and she loved it.  She just thought it was a little spicy.  All in All, it's a little pricey but over all worth.

### Dessert
*Banana Cake* - Espresso Mousse, bruleed banana, caramelize white chocolate crunch
- What a great dessert.  Though the bruleed banana was 'meh' to me.  To be honest I think if it just had fresh banana with a bruleed caramel on top of the cake it would have been divine.  Over all I think it was definitely worth.

*Chocolate Malabi* - Sweet & salty almonds, toasted benne seeds
- Another 'simple, yet satisfying'.  Never had malabi before but was it delicious.  Reminded me of something in between a pudding and mousse.  Plus the sweet & saltiness from the almonds and toasted benne seed adds another dimension with the crunch.  Definitely worth.

### Overall Thoughts
I thought this was a great spot.  Atmosphere was industrial kitchen feel, which I am just a sucker for.  It was busy for a Wednesday night, but definitely quiet enough to easily talk to whoever you're eating with.  The service was great, it's slower and more chill, but they will definitely make sure you have everything you need.  I actually like it a little slower like it was as they weren't always in your face asking how your food is.  The price is a little high for the amount of food you get, but the nice thing was that we didn't end up with leftovers.  This is a great spot to go with a small group of friends or for a intimate date night.

### TLDR
- Price: 6/10 (lower = more expensive)
- Food: 7/10 
- Drinks: n/a (I didn't have any)
- Service: 8/10
- Atmosphere: 8/10
- Overall: 29/40 

Great place to have an intimate date or grab dinner with a small group of friends.  A little pricey, but overall worth.
